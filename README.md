## Deep Learning Transformer for Sentiment Analysis

The deep learning transformer designed for sentiment analysis is a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. Leveraging the power of transformers, it dissects text input into smaller tokens using techniques from libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to process and understand the sentiment behind the provided sentences.

This transformer model operates by breaking down the sentence into tokens, effectively capturing the nuanced meaning of each word or phrase. It comprehends the contextual relationships between these tokens, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of sentiment.

Through its sophisticated architecture, this model can discern the emotional tone of the input text, distinguishing between positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Additionally, it offers the capability to provide a quantitative assessment, presenting the percentage distribution of positive and negative sentiments within the sentence.

By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning and NLP techniques, this transformer-based sentiment analysis model contributes to more accurate and nuanced interpretations of textual sentiment, enabling a deeper understanding of the emotional context within language.
